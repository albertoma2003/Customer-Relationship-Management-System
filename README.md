# Customer-Relationship-Management-System-in-C-
C++

I chose to build this project to put myself in the shoes of what a software developer might be tasked to do for a small company or startup.
I believe it is very important to be able to connect your programming projects to real-world scenarios because it motivates me to not only master the material but to be efficient in doing so.

My biggest challenge in this project was the database class implementation because nothing else would function properly without it.
The database class was tasked with holding all the data of all valid purchases (customers who made purchases of $0 were not recorded in the database) and was dynamically allocated on the heap.
I tackled this challenge by writing one function at a time and debugging them to see if the database class was properly updated when necessary and 
to see the changes that are made in memory and in my local and static variables.

My most significant takeaway about this project was to always sketch out your ideas of how you may want to implement your goal through pseudo-code first.
Taking the time to do so will lead to clean coding and will make debugging your code throughout the process a lot easier as you'll be able to refer back to your initial sketch.
This takeaway has not only benefitted me for the projects I have completed after this one but will also help me write clean and organized code in the future at an internship or a full-time position.

I got stuck many times throughout this project. My three main areas of trouble were: debugging my database class, avoiding memory leaks, and passing edge cases like customers making non-valid purchases.
I knew the only way to get unstuck was by debugging only parts of my code at a time, referencing my code with a friend to have a fresh set of eyes give me their opinion on the way I implemented some functions,
and by taking my time to really dive deep into every line of code to understand their purpose.
